# Bayesian_options_hedge


This is an illustration of optimizing the best time to buy options as a hedge to portfolios using Bayesian Optimization, our goal is to find the optimal option parameters (such as strike price and time to expiration) that maximize the protection provided by the options while minimizing the cost of buying them.


This process involves using Bayesian Optimization to explore the parameter space and determine when and how to purchase options effectively for hedging purposes.
The goal is to optimize the timing and structure of buying options (such as strike price and expiration) to minimize risk and cost, while providing adequate protection to the portfolio.

Variables and Parameters:
Strike price factor (K_f): This is the strike price of the option as a percentage of the current stock price, represented as a factor. For example, K_f = 0.95 means the strike price is 95% of the current stock price.
K = K_f * S_0
Where:
S_0 is the stock price at the time of the option purchase.
K is the actual strike price of the option.
Time to expiration (T): The time until the option expires, measured in years (e.g., 0.25 years for a 3-month option).

Volatility (sigma): This is the expected volatility of the stock's returns, which affects the option price (higher volatility increases the option premium).

Option cost (C): This is the cost of buying the option, which is determined using the Black-Scholes formula or a similar model.


Step 1: Define the Objective Function
The objective function measures the performance of the portfolio, taking into account both the cost of the hedge (the premium paid for options) and the protection provided by the options. We want to maximize protection while minimizing the cost of the options.
We define the portfolio return as:
R_t = R_portfolio + R_option
Where:
R_portfolio is the return of the portfolio (without the hedge).
R_option is the return provided by the option hedge (positive if the hedge is successful).

The objective function will return the negative of the net return (to minimize it, since gp_minimize minimizes the objective function):
Objective = -(R_t - C)
Where C is the cost of buying the options, calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing formula.


Step 2: Black-Scholes Option Pricing Formula
We use the Black-Scholes model to price the option and determine the cost of hedging:
C = BlackScholes(S, K, T, r, sigma, option_type)
Where:
S is the current stock price.
K is the strike price.
T is the time to expiration (in years).
r is the risk-free interest rate.
sigma is the volatility of the stock.
option_type is either 'call' or 'put'.

For a put option (used to protect against a decline in stock price):
C_put = K * exp(-r * T) * N(-d2) - S * N(-d1)
Where:
N(d1) and N(d2) are the cumulative distribution functions of the standard normal distribution.
d1 = (ln(S / K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma^2) * T) / (sigma * sqrt(T))
d2 = d1 - sigma * sqrt(T)


Step 3: Simulation of Portfolio Returns with a Hedging Strategy
Once we have the option cost (C), we need to simulate how the portfolio performs when hedged with the option.
Portfolio return without hedge (R_portfolio):
R_portfolio = (S_t - S_t-1) / S_t-1
Where:
S_t is the stock price at time t.
S_t-1 is the stock price at the previous time step.

Hedge return (R_option):
If the stock price drops below the strike price, the option provides protection by paying out the difference between the strike price and the stock price:
R_option = (K - S_t) / K  if S_t < K, otherwise 0

Net return with hedge:
R_t = R_portfolio + R_option
We then calculate the mean return and mean option cost over the entire simulation period.


Step 4: Bayesian Optimization Setup
Bayesian Optimization works by searching for the optimal parameters (strike price factor K_f, time to expiration T, and volatility sigma) that minimize the objective function.

We define the search space for the parameters:

Strike Price Factor (K_f): This is the strike price as a percentage of the current stock price. The range is typically between 0.9 and 1.1 (90% to 110% of the stock price).
K_f \in [0.9, 1.1]

Time to Expiration (T): The range is from a short expiration (e.g., 0.01 years or about 3 days) to a longer expiration (e.g., 1 year).
T \in [0.01, 1.0]

Volatility (sigma): This is the expected volatility of the stock, typically ranging from 0.1 (10%) to 0.5 (50%).
sigma \in [0.1, 0.5]


Step 5: Run Bayesian Optimization
Once the search space is defined, we use Bayesian Optimization to explore the parameter space and find the optimal values that minimize the objective function.

The optimization algorithm performs the following steps:
Initial Exploration: It starts by sampling random points in the search space.
Gaussian Process Modeling: A Gaussian Process model is used to approximate the objective function.
Acquisition Function: The acquisition function determines the next point to sample by balancing exploration (sampling unexplored areas) and exploitation (sampling promising areas).
Minimization: It continues iterating until it finds the optimal parameters that minimize the objective function.
The optimal parameters found by Bayesian Optimization will represent the best time and structure for buying options to hedge the portfolio.


Step 6: Evaluation
Once the optimization is complete, the optimal parameters are reported:
Optimal strike price factor (K_f): The best strike price as a percentage of the current stock price.
Optimal time to expiration (T): The best expiration time for the options.
Optimal volatility (sigma): The best volatility assumption for pricing the options.
Finally, we evaluate the performance of the portfolio using these optimal parameters and calculate key metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio or profit and loss (P&L).
